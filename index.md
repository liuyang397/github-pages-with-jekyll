# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how I met my husband.

It was a weekend I went to visit my uncle who was the boss of my husband. The first time I saw him, he was talking to boss and then started crying. WHAT? It sure gave me an unforgettable impression but not in a very 'good' way. One word that popped into my head was 'naive'. Oh baby boy!
